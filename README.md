# hello-world

I was reading about AppImage to create linux software and crossed a reference to github and thought I'd check it out.

I've worked and played in many languages: APL, 6502 ML, BAL, BASIC (BasCom to VB6) C, Cobol, Euphoria (DOS & Win), Forth, Fortran, Pascal, Rebol and others I've forgotten. Professionally an obsolete VB6/SQL client-server programmer (one project I was personally responsible for over a million lines of code.)

Not happy with the tools I have now since VB6/SQL not an option. I do like SQLite, but I need the other aspects of a hosted server project. Tried SQLitening with PowerBasic but that's far from ideal. I just want to get stuff done like I used to be able to do.

VB6 is not an option because I want a single executable file to avoid much user support as I'm alone now with no team.
